# Password generator for challenge three of the boot camp.

## Description

For the third challenge of the boot camp, I was tasked with creating a password generator website. The user will select prompts for password length, as well as the inclusion of special characters, numerical characters, upper and lowercase letters. Upon selection, the website will present the user with a password of their desired length and character specifications.
